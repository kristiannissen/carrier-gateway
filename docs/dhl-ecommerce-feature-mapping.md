---

## Implementation notes

**Two separate credentials.** The eConnect booking API uses OAuth2 (clientID +
clientSecret). The DHL Unified Tracking API uses a separate API key
(`DHL_TRACKING_API_KEY`). Both are required for full functionality.

**SEPA COD.** DHL eCommerce Europe COD uses SEPA bank transfer — not cash on
delivery to a courier. Requires a valid IBAN and BIC. Only available on the
`DHL Parcel Connect` (ParcelEurope.parcelconnect) product.

**Labelless returns.** The QR code / GIF return flow is DHL Parcel Return
Connect only. The customer uses the code to drop off at a DHL service point
without printing a label. Return instructions (multi-language) must be
provided separately — request from DHL.

**Coverage.** 28 European countries. Not a domestic carrier — intended for
cross-border B2C flows originating from a European hub (typically DE or NL).

| `POST /api/manifests` | `POST /shipping/v4/manifest` + `GET /shipping/v4/manifest/{pickup}/{requestId}` | ✅ |

---

## Implementation notes

**Async two-step flow.** Manifest creation is asynchronous. `POST /shipping/v4/manifest`
returns a `requestId` immediately; the adapter polls `GET /shipping/v4/manifest/{pickup}/{requestId}`
every 2 seconds (default) until `status` reaches `COMPLETED`. Default poll
timeout is 60 seconds, configurable via `DHLECSAdapter.PollTimeout`.

**Pickup account number.** Every manifest request requires a DHL eCommerce
pickup account number (`DHLECS_PICKUP_ACCOUNT`). This is separate from the
OAuth2 credentials and is issued by DHL when the account is set up.

**Environment variables.**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DHLECS_CLIENT_ID` | ✅ | OAuth2 client_id |
| `DHLECS_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✅ | OAuth2 client_secret |
| `DHLECS_PICKUP_ACCOUNT` | ✅ | DHL pickup account number (e.g. `5234567`) |

**Specific vs. all-open manifesting.** Pass `trackingNumbers` in the
`POST /api/manifests` request body to manifest only those package IDs. Omit
`trackingNumbers` (or pass an empty array) to sweep all open packages for
the pickup account. The all-open mode manifests the last 20,000 labels and
may include packages not intended for the current run — use specific IDs
where possible.
