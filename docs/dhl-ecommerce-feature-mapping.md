## Feature fit/gap

### Booking

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Book shipment | ✅ | `POST /ccc/send-cpan` — label returned in response |
| Cancel shipment | ❌ | No cancellation endpoint in eConnect API |
| Update shipment | ❌ | No update endpoint in eConnect API |
| Idempotency key | ❌ | Client-side only |

### Labels

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Print label | ✅ | `GET /ccc/label-reprint` |
| Label formats | ✅ | PDF only. PNG and ZPL are available in the DHL eConnect API schema but not wired — `FetchLabel` returns `501` for non-PDF formats. |
| Return label | ✅ | DHL Parcel Return Connect product (`DeliveryType=return`) |
| Labelless return | ✅ | QR code / GIF format — DHL Parcel Return Connect (`returnFunctionality=labelless`) |

### Tracking

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Current status | ✅ | DHL Unified Tracking API — normalized status |
| Event history | ✅ | Scan events returned in `events[]` |
| Event detail text | ✅ | `statusDetailed` used when present; falls back to `status` short title |
| Estimated delivery | ✅ | `estimatedTimeOfDelivery` where returned; falls back to `estimatedDeliveryTimeFrame.estimatedFrom` |
| Tracking API key | ⚠️ | Separate credential (`DHL_TRACKING_API_KEY`) from eConnect booking credentials |
| Response schema | ✅ | OpenAPI 3.0 spec available at `APIdocs/dhl_unified_track_6.yaml` (v1.5.8). Field mapping is validated against this spec. |
| Status code normalization | ✅ | `normalizeStatus("dhl", statusCode)` maps the five high-level `statusCode` values (`delivered`, `failure`, `pre-transit`, `transit`, `unknown`) from the spec. Full raw event code reference (per service variant) in `APIdocs/dhl_status_1.csv`. |
| Proof of Delivery (POD) | ✅ | `proofOfDelivery.documentUrl`, `signatureUrl`, `signed` (name), and `timestamp` mapped to `TrackingResponse.ProofOfDelivery`. Available from DHL Express and DHL Freight after postal-code validation. Field is omitted when the carrier has not yet confirmed delivery. |
| Piece-level tracking | ❌ | Not implemented. `details.pieceIds[]` and per-event `pieceIds[]` are in the spec but not mapped. |
| Rate limiting | ⚠️ | Default quota is 250 calls/day, 1 per 5 seconds — insufficient for production. No throttle/retry logic in adapter. Request upgrade via DHL developer portal. |
| `service` parameter | ✅ | Configurable via `DHLAdapter.TrackingService`. Defaults to `"ecommerce-europe"`. Set to `""` for API auto-detection, or to any of the 17 valid service values (`express`, `parcel-de`, `parcel-nl`, `freight`, `dgf`, etc.). |

---

## Implementation notes

**Two separate credentials.** The eConnect booking API uses OAuth2 (clientID +
clientSecret). The DHL Unified Tracking API uses a separate API key
(`DHL_TRACKING_API_KEY`). Both are required for full functionality.

**Tracking spec.** `APIdocs/dhl_unified_track_6.yaml` is the full OpenAPI 3.0
spec (v1.5.8) for the DHL Unified Tracking API. `APIdocs/dhl_status_1.csv`
provides the exhaustive raw event status code reference for all service variants.
These supersede the earlier `DHL_Shipment Tracking_2_0.yaml` stub (which is a
WADL pointer with no schemas) and `dhl_tracking_unified.md` (narrative overview
only). Use the YAML as the authoritative reference for piece-level tracking and
extended status normalization work.

**Proof of Delivery.** `TrackingResponse.ProofOfDelivery` is populated when the
carrier returns `proofOfDelivery.documentUrl` or `signatureUrl` in the tracking
response. Available for DHL Express and DHL Freight after successful postal-code
validation — the API returns an empty object before delivery is confirmed, which
the adapter treats as absent. The digital signature (hand-held device capture) is
typically available the next business day after delivery. `signedBy` is resolved
from `signed.name`, falling back to `givenName + familyName`, then
`organizationName`.

**Tracking rate limits.** The initial quota on a new DHL API key is 250 calls/day
with a 1 call/5 second burst limit. This is only suitable for development. Request
a production upgrade via the DHL developer portal before going live. The adapter
has no retry or throttle logic — a 429 response will surface as an error.

**Service hint (`TrackingService`).** `DHLAdapter.TrackingService` controls the
`service` query parameter on tracking requests. It defaults to `"ecommerce-europe"`.
Override it on the struct for other DHL service variants (e.g. `"parcel-de"` for
German domestic, `"express"` for DHL Express, `"freight"` for road freight).
Set to `""` to omit the hint entirely and let the API auto-detect — slower but
correct when the service is unknown. All 17 valid values are listed in the struct
godoc and in the `Service` enum of `APIdocs/dhl_unified_track_6.yaml`.

**SEPA COD.** DHL eCommerce Europe COD uses SEPA bank transfer — not cash on
delivery to a courier. Requires a valid IBAN and BIC. Only available on the
`DHL Parcel Connect` (ParcelEurope.parcelconnect) product.

**Labelless returns.** The QR code / GIF return flow is DHL Parcel Return
Connect only. The customer uses the code to drop off at a DHL service point
without printing a label. Return instructions (multi-language) must be
provided separately — request from DHL.

**Coverage.** 28 European countries. Not a domestic carrier — intended for
cross-border B2C flows originating from a European hub (typically DE or NL).

## Endpoint mapping

| carrier-gateway | DHL eCommerce Americas API | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/bookings` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `DELETE /api/bookings/{id}` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `PATCH /api/bookings/{id}` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `GET /api/trackings/{id}` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `GET /api/labels/{id}` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `POST /api/pickups` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `PUT /api/pickups/{id}` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `DELETE /api/pickups/{id}` | — | ❌ → 501 |
| `POST /api/manifests` | `POST /shipping/v4/manifest` + `GET /shipping/v4/manifest/{pickup}/{requestId}` | ✅ |

---

## Implementation notes

**Async two-step flow.** Manifest creation is asynchronous. `POST /shipping/v4/manifest`
returns a `requestId` immediately; the adapter polls `GET /shipping/v4/manifest/{pickup}/{requestId}`
every 2 seconds (default) until `status` reaches `COMPLETED`. Default poll
timeout is 60 seconds, configurable via `DHLECSAdapter.PollTimeout`.

**Pickup account number.** Every manifest request requires a DHL eCommerce
pickup account number (`DHLECS_PICKUP_ACCOUNT`). This is separate from the
OAuth2 credentials and is issued by DHL when the account is set up.

**Environment variables.**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DHLECS_CLIENT_ID` | ✅ | OAuth2 client_id |
| `DHLECS_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✅ | OAuth2 client_secret |
| `DHLECS_PICKUP_ACCOUNT` | ✅ | DHL pickup account number (e.g. `5234567`) |

**Specific vs. all-open manifesting.** Pass `trackingNumbers` in the
`POST /api/manifests` request body to manifest only those package IDs. Omit
`trackingNumbers` (or pass an empty array) to sweep all open packages for
the pickup account. The all-open mode manifests the last 20,000 labels and
may include packages not intended for the current run — use specific IDs
where possible.

---

## Cancellation caveat

The DHL UK cancellation endpoint requires the consignee postal code alongside
the shipment ID. The `CarrierAdapter.CancelShipment` interface only exposes the
tracking number. To bridge this gap the adapter caches `shipmentID → postalCode`
at booking time. Shipments booked outside this process (e.g. in a different pod
or after a restart) cannot be cancelled via the API interface — contact DHL
customer service in those cases.

Shipments already scanned at a DHL depot cannot be cancelled. If a cancellation
was requested before scanning but the parcel is later scanned anyway, DHL
automatically recreates the shipment.
