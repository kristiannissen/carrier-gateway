# Manifest & Pickup Scheduling — Requirements

## Background

Shipments are booked individually throughout the day as orders are packed
(`POST /api/bookings`). At end of day the warehouse hands over the parcels to
the carrier. This document covers the two API operations that support that
handover.

---

## The outbound handover process

```
Book shipments  →  Schedule pickup  →  Truck arrives  →  Handover document
(existing)         (new)               (carrier-side)    (new)
```

**Schedule pickup** — the warehouse tells the carrier when and where to collect.
Done once per carrier per day, typically at the start of or during the day.
Some carriers make this optional if a standing collection agreement exists.

**Handover document (manifest)** — a record of what was loaded onto the truck.
For most carriers this is generated or retrieved after collection. For a small
number of carriers (GLS) it must be submitted before the driver arrives and
effectively acts as the collection order.

These two operations are independent. Pickup scheduling causes the truck to come.
The manifest documents what went on it.

---

## Scope

**Implemented:** Bring, DPD, FedEx, PostNord (BookPickup only — see below).

**In scope, not yet implemented:** GLS, DHL Express.

**Unknown / not yet researched:** DAO, DHL eCommerce Europe, Hermes (HSI).

**Out of scope:** Instabee.

| `estimatedParcels` | int | Estimated number of parcels | No |
| `estimatedWeight` | float | Estimated total weight in kg | No |

#### Response

```json
{
  "carrier": "dhl_express",
  "confirmationNumber": "PRG999126012345",
  "date": "2026-06-13",
  "readyTime": "14:00",
  "closeTime": "18:00",
  "status": "booked"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `booked` |
| `confirmationNumber` | string | Carrier-issued pickup confirmation reference |
| `readyTime` | string | Confirmed earliest pickup time from the carrier. May differ from the requested time, or be absent if the carrier does not return a window. |
| `closeTime` | string | Confirmed latest pickup time from the carrier. May differ from the requested time, or be absent if the carrier does not return a window. |

---

### `PUT /api/pickups/{confirmationNumber}`

Updates a previously booked pickup. The request body follows the same shape as
`POST /api/pickups`. Only fields that differ from the original booking need to
be included; omitted fields are left unchanged.

```
PUT /api/pickups/PRG999126012345?carrier=dhl_express
```

```json
{
  "pickup": {
    "date": "2026-06-13",
    "readyTime": "15:00",
    "closeTime": "18:00"
  }
}
```

#### Response — success

```json
{
  "carrier": "dhl_express",
  "confirmationNumber": "PRG999126012345",
  "date": "2026-06-13",
  "readyTime": "15:00",
  "closeTime": "18:00",
  "status": "updated"
}
```

#### Response — carrier does not support update

HTTP `501` with:

```json
{
  "error": "carrier bring does not support pickup update"
}
```

---

### `DELETE /api/pickups/{confirmationNumber}`

Cancels a previously booked pickup.

```
DELETE /api/pickups/PRG999126012345?carrier=dhl_express
```

#### Response — success

```json
{"confirmationNumber": "PRG999126012345", "carrier": "dhl_express", "status": "cancelled"}
```

#### Response — carrier does not support cancel

HTTP `501` with:

```json
{
  "error": "carrier bring does not support pickup cancellation"
}
```

---

### `GET /api/pickups/availability`

Returns available collection timeslots for a given address before booking a
pickup. Callers should invoke this before `POST /api/pickups` when the carrier
requires a pre-flight check to avoid availability-zone errors (e.g. Omniva).

```
GET /api/pickups/availability?carrier=fedex&street=Industrivej&city=Copenhagen&postalCode=2300&country=DK
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "carrier": "fedex",
  "slots": [
    {"date": "2026-06-13", "startTime": "14:00", "endTime": "18:00"},
    {"date": "2026-06-14", "startTime": "08:00", "endTime": "12:00"}
  ]
}
```

Carriers that do not require or support availability queries return HTTP `501`.
Callers may proceed directly to `POST /api/pickups` in that case.

---

### `POST /api/manifests`

Retrieves or generates the handover document for a carrier and shipping day.
For carriers that require a close call before collection (GLS), this also
submits the end-of-day instruction to the carrier.

#### Request

```json
{
  "carrier": "gls",
  "date": "2026-06-12",
  "trackingNumbers": ["1Z999AA10123456784", "1Z999AA10123456785"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `carrier` | string | Carrier key | Yes |
| `date` | string | ISO 8601 date — the shipping day | Yes |
| `trackingNumbers` | array | Tracking numbers to include. Required for carriers that need an explicit list; ignored by carriers that close server-side. | No |

#### Response

```json
{
  "carrier": "gls",
  "date": "2026-06-12",
  "status": "closed",
  "parcelsConfirmed": 42,
  "manifestDocument": "JVBERi0xLj...",
  "manifestDocumentFormat": "PDF",
  "warnings": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `closed` |
| `parcelsConfirmed` | int | Number of parcels confirmed, where returned by carrier |
| `manifestDocument` | string | Base64-encoded manifest document, where returned by carrier |
| `manifestDocumentFormat` | string | `PDF` |
| `warnings` | array | Any non-fatal issues |

## PostNord pickup — implementation notes

Implemented. PostNord's `/v3/pickups/ids` takes an array of item IDs (the
barcode identifiers returned in the booking response) and a time window.
`internal/adapter/postnord.go`'s `BookPickup`:

1. Accepts item IDs via the `trackingNumbers` field on the pickup request —
   the gateway is stateless, so it does not retrieve them from any booking
   record itself; callers must pass back the IDs from `BookShipment`.
2. Maps `pickup.readyTime` → `earliestPickupDate` and `pickup.closeTime` →
   `latestPickupDate` (both as RFC3339 datetimes, combined with `pickup.date`;
   defaults to 09:00/18:00 when omitted).
3. Returns the `bookingId` from the response as `confirmationNumber`.

Geographic limitation: domestic SE, DK, FI only. If `Address.Country` is
supplied and is anything else (e.g. `NO`), the request is rejected
client-side rather than sent to PostNord.

`/v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` could validate `pickup.date` against PostNord's
actual cutoff windows before submitting, but is not wired — see
`docs/postnord-feature-mapping.md` for this remaining `GetCutoffTime` gap.

## Implementation state

### Files added

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `internal/handler/manifests.go` | `POST /api/manifests` handler |
| `internal/handler/pickups.go` | `POST /api/pickups`, `PUT /api/pickups/{id}`, `DELETE /api/pickups/{id}`, `GET /api/pickups/availability` handlers |
| `internal/adapter/manifest.go` | `ManifestAdapter` interface, pickup/manifest types |

### Adapter status

| Adapter | `ManifestAdapter` implemented |
|---|---|
| `bring.go` | ✅ BookPickup wired; Update/Cancel/CloseManifest/Availability return 501 |
| `dpd.go` | ✅ BookPickup wired; Update/Cancel/CloseManifest/Availability return 501 |
| `fedex.go` | ✅ BookPickup, CancelPickup, CloseManifest, GetPickupAvailability wired; Update returns 501 |
| `gls.go` | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| `dhl_express.go` | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| `postnord.go` | ✅ BookPickup wired; Update/Cancel/CloseManifest/Availability return 501 (confirmed limitations) |
| `dao.go` | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| `hermes.go` | ❌ Not yet implemented |

### Interface design

`ManifestAdapter` is defined separately from `CarrierAdapter`. A carrier that
does not implement `ManifestAdapter` at all returns HTTP `501` via a failed
type assertion in the handler. A carrier that implements the interface but
returns `ErrNotSupported` for a specific method also returns HTTP `501`.

```
CarrierAdapter      — booking, tracking, labels, cancellation
ManifestAdapter     — BookPickup, UpdatePickup, CancelPickup, GetPickupAvailability, CloseManifest
```

```json
{"error": "carrier postnord does not support manifest close"}
```

---

## Validation rules

- `pickup.date` must not be in the past.
- If both `pickup.readyTime` and `pickup.closeTime` are provided, `readyTime` must be before `closeTime`.
- The confirmed window in the response reflects what the carrier actually scheduled, which may differ from the requested times.
- `date` on manifest request must not be in the future.
- `carrier` must be a known key; unknown carriers return `400`.
