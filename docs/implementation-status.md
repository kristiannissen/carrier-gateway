## Priority gaps

Issues that affect production operations and should be addressed next.

1. **GLS manifest (end-of-day close)** — `POST /rs/shipments/endofday` must be
   wired before GLS can be used in production. Without it the driver will not
   collect the parcels.

2. **GLS pickup (sporadic collection)** — `POST /rs/sporadicollection` exists
   in the API but is not wired.

3. **FedEx label reprint** — `FetchLabel` returns `ErrNotSupported`. Labels
   must be stored from the booking response. Spec review pending.

4. **FedEx COD** — `shipmentCODDetail` is wired but FedEx only supports COD on
   Ground services. Express shipments with `AddOnCashOnDelivery` will be
   rejected by FedEx at the API level.

5. **DHL Express standalone pickup booking** — `POST /api/pickups` for DHL
   Express is not wired. Pickup is currently triggered only via the booking
   call.

6. **InPost go-live** — set `INPOST_CLIENT_ID`, `INPOST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INPOST_ORG_ID`
   and run integration tests against `stage-api.inpost-group.com` before switching to
   production. Adapter is fully implemented.

7. **DPD tracking** — `GET /shipments/{id}` returns a numeric internal status
   code only. Full event tracking requires the separate DPD Tracking API
   (separate credentials).

8. **DHL eCommerce UK — cancellation postal code** — `CancelShipment` requires
   the consignee postal code alongside the shipment ID, but the `CarrierAdapter`
   interface only exposes the tracking number. The adapter caches the postal code
   at booking time; shipments booked in a different process or after a restart
   cannot be cancelled via the API. Resolve by storing the postal code externally
   (e.g. in the order database) and injecting it, or by extending the interface.

9. **DHL eCommerce UK — Windsor Framework (GB → NI)** — shipments from Great
   Britain to Northern Ireland require a `clearanceDeclaration` block
   (`C2C`/`C2B`/`B2C`/`B2B` Green/Red Lane). No `Customs` fields map to this
   yet. Must be added before routing GB→NI lanes through this adapter.

10. **DHL eCommerce UK — amendment** — `UpdateShipment` returns 501. The
    `/shipping/v1/amendment` endpoint supports post-booking address and weight
    changes but its schema is incompatible with `UpdateRequest`. Wire when the
    interface is extended.
